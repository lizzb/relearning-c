/**

 *  
The implementation of this module will provide a
spell-checking capability that can be used  by a calling module.

 Design considerations for the spell-checker include: 

 1. Scalable to large word dictionary 
 2. optimize efficiency of spell checking large # of large documents with single dictionary
 3. performance of spell checking first, second is mem efficiency and cost of building dict
 4. nothing external


 *     1. It should scale to a large word dictionary (on the
 *     order of the size of the English language)

 *     2. It should optimize for efficiency of spell-checking
 *     a large number of large documents with a single
 *     dictionary.

 *     3. Memory efficiency of the dictionary and cost of
 *     building the dictionary are considerations, but are
 *     secondary to performance of spell-checking.

 *     4. Use of 3rd-party functions and libraries is
 *     prohibited, other than the basic functions provided by
 *     glibc.
